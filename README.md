## Overview
This project attempts to examine differences in people's preferences between tipping at restaurants and paying for the tip included in the meal price. It does so through a survey that simulates ordering items from a menu, assigns subjects to tipping and included-tip receipts, and asks whether they think the price for the meal was reasonable or not.

## Survey Design

*to be fleshed out*

## Tools
We implemented the survey in Qualtrics and are using Amazon Mechanical Turk to recruit survey users with an incentive *$0.05(?)* per survey completion.
